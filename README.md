## About
Hi, I'm Alex! I am an M.D. student and Ph.D. candidate in the [Medical Scientist Training Program](https://medicine.uiowa.edu/mstp/) at the University of Iowa.

## Research Interests
My primary interest is the genetics of cardiovascular disease, with particular interest in inherited sudden cardiac death. I am conducting my graduate work with Dr. Barry London. My doctoral works examines the genetic basis of sudden cardiac death syndromes in multigenerational families. I use a combination of genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics in my research.

I also have interests in cellular electrophysiology, big data, publicly-available data, and reducing repetitive laboratory tasks through programming. To this extent, I have written a number of small programs which aid in data analysis or repetitive laboratory tasks.
